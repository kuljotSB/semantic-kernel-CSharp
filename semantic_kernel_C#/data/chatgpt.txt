ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI. It was launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT enables users to engage in human-like conversations and refine the dialogue towards desired length, format, style, and language. It considers successive user prompts and replies as context. ChatGPT’s release sparked an AI boom, leading to rapid investment in artificial intelligence. It’s built on OpenAI’s proprietary generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, fine-tuned for conversational applications using supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Initially released as a research preview, ChatGPT now operates on a freemium model, offering additional features like DALL-E 3 image generation and increased usage limits
